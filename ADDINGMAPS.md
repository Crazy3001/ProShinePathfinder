## - The map system
The map system is located in `Pathfinder/Maps`, they are two big sections.  
- The maps for the algorithm, such as the Regions maps. they represent Nodes and Links, a node is a Map and links are the possible Maps accessible from it.
- The Exceptions maps, inside `MapExceptions`.

aswell as the maps for pokecenters and items used by API calls like moveToPC().  
`GlobalMap` and `LinkMap` are used to link the main regions maps together.  
### - Understanding the need for exceptions:
Sometimes map have the same name in the game, but you can only access a part of them because of your team, items or simply they are not at the same locations  
For example there could be water in the middle of a map, then you need to have `surf` to be able to cross that part.  
Another example would be `Route 2`: there are parts before and after the forest, some part you only access with cut.  
In these cases the maps need to be subdevided for the algorithm to make no mistakes.  
Example: If we are on topside of `route 2` then the closest Pokecenter would be in `Pewter City`, if we are on the bottom side then it's in `Viridian City`.  
If there is a reason that could prevent you from moving to another link from the current map, you should make exceptions.  
There are exceptions aswell if moving the a link require talking to a NPC.
### - Adding map without exceptions:
Take a look at the regions maps for example [Kanto](https://github.com/MeltWS/ProShinePathfinder/blob/master/Pathfinder/Maps/Kanto/KantoMap.lua)  
```lua
KantoMap["node"] = {["link1"] = {distance1}, ["link2"] = {distance2}}
```
The node is the name of the Map  
We can have as many links as we need, they MUST be the name of other nodes in the map, they MUST have a number distance.  
Example :
```lua
KantoMap["Player Bedroom Pallet"] = {["Player House Pallet"] = {1}}
```
  
Sometimes you can have restrictions on a link, for example if you need surf.  
`-- KantoMap["node"] = {["link"] = {distance, {["restrictionType"] = {"restriction"}}}}`
The restrictionType must be either `abilities` or `items`, there can be multiple restrictions. The account must meet all `restriction` paired to `restrictionType` in order to make the link valid  
Example:
```lua
KantoMap["Pallet Town"] = {["Player House Pallet"] = {1}, ["Route 21"] = {1, {["abilities"] = {"surf"}}}, ["Route 1"] = {1}}
```
Here the link will only be valid if the player has `surf`  
### - Exceptions handling:
- Substitutes Maps
If the map must be subdivided we need to know which part are which, so we defined substitute maps with rectangles. See the file `MapExceptions/SubstituteMaps`.  
```lua
    ["In Game Map Name"] = {
        ["SubMap_X] = {{x1, y1, x2, y2}, {x1, y1, x2, y2}} -- location of the submap
        ["SubMap_Y] = {{x1, y1, x2, y2}} -- location of the submap
    },
    ["Route 2"] = {
        ["Route 2_A"] = {{7, 0, 28, 31}, {7, 33, 11, 42}}, -- top / pewter side
        ["Route 2_B"] = {{19, 32, 42, 89}}, -- top right / digletts side
        ["Route 2_C"] = {{7, 96, 25, 130}}, -- down right / bottom of stop house 3
        ["Route 2_D"] = {{26, 96, 42, 127}} -- bottom / viridian side
        },
```
There can be as many rectangles as you need to, the rectangles MUST cover the whole submap area.  
Adding all sumap rectangles MUST cover the whole map Area.  
Route 2 is subdevided is four submaps.  
  
We also need to define links, as for any other maps:  
```lua
KantoMap["Route 2_A"] = {["Pewter City"] = {1}, ["Viridian Forest"] = {1}, ["Route 2_B"] = {0, {["abilities"] = {"cut"}}}}
KantoMap["Route 2_B"] = {["Route 11"] = {1, {["abilities"] = {"dig"}}}, ["Route 2_A"] = {0, {["abilities"] = {"cut"}}}, ["Route 2 Stop3"] = {1}}
KantoMap["Route 2_C"] = {["Viridian City"] = {1}, ["Route 2_D"] = {1, {["abilities"] = {"cut"}}}, ["Route 2 Stop"] = {1}}
KantoMap["Route 2_D"] = {["Route 2 Stop3"] = {1}, ["Route 2_C"] = {0, {["abilities"] = {"cut"}}}}
```
Here we have distance 0 because we do not want the algorithm to weight the path between submap, it could have been 0.2 or something else aswell.  
Note that each submap have it's own links and restrictions.  
  
Sometimes after subdivising Maps the script will need to know which specific cell to go, because a map can link to multiple submaps with the same parent map, and Proshine won't understand moveToMap(Route 2_B). And if we use moveToMap("Route 2") it will go to the closest submap, which we do not always want. Therefore we need linkExceptions:  
located in `LinkExceptions`  
```lua
linkExce["node"] = {
    ["destNode"] = {x, y} -- the cell which teleports to destNode from node.
}
linkExce["Route 2 Stop3"] = {
    ["Route 2_B"] = {3, 2}, -- top
    ["Route 2_D"] = {3, 12} -- down
}
```
The pathfinder will know which cell to go to access submaps `B` and `D` from `Route 2 Stop3`.  
- Npc Exceptions
If moving from a map A to a map B requires talking to a NPC you must fill the data inside `NpcExceptions`  
```lua
npcExce["node"] = {
    ["destNode"] = {{npcX, npcY}, dialogAnswer, "dialogCheck"}
}
npcExce["Lilycove City Harbor"] = {
    ["Vermilion City_A"] = {{8, 10}, "Vermilion City", "Where do you want to go?"},
    ["Olivine City"] = {{8, 10}, "Olivine City", "Where do you want to go?"}
}
```
The dialogs must be the full sentences.
